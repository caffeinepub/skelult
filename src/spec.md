## Summary
**Goal:** Add SkelUlt logo to the header and implement an Enable/Disable follow button with smooth animation on video cards.

**Planned changes:**
- Add small SkelUlt logo to top-left corner of Layout header that displays consistently in light and dark modes
- Add Enable button next to the like button on VideoCard component for following video creators
- Implement smooth animation transitioning Enable button to Disable button on click
