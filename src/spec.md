# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Pending Friend Requests section visible in the SkelMsg messaging interface.

**Planned changes:**
- Render the FriendRequestsList component in the MessagingPage so it's visible to users
- Position the Pending Friend Requests section prominently above or alongside the conversation list
- Ensure useGetFriendRequests hook is properly called to fetch and display pending requests
- Add clear heading and neon-themed styling to make the section stand out

**User-visible outcome:** Users can now see their pending friend requests directly in SkelMsg with accept/decline buttons, styled consistently with the neon theme.
