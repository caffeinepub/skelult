  "summary": "The diff implements 3 of 4 requirements. REQ-40 (SkelUlt logo in Layout header) and REQ-41/42/43 (Enable/Disable follow button with animations) are implemented. However, the actual logo image file (skelult-logo.dim_200x60.png) is not present in the diff, creating an implementation gap.",
